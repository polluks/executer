This WIP and not properly tested. Especially use/save functionality. Amiga
Gadtools versions GUI does not work properly. AmigaGuide is also WIP.

========
EXECUTER
========

Small utility to run command or script when some action happens to file or
directory. Possible actions are modify, delete or create. Multiple files and
directories are supported.

Preferences file is human readable and editable using text editor without
Executer-preferences editor.

Check the Executer.guide for further information.

- MUI3.8 + MUI BetterString
- AREXX

MorphOS 3.x.
- MUI BetterString

Amiga 3.x - Gadtools version

Suitable Filesystem for dos.librarys notify requester. Yes, support from
filesystem is required. RAM-disk, SFS and  UAE "directory" drives works.

-------
INSTALL
-------

Copy executer to C: and start application from commandline.

To get prefs visible run it again or sent AREXX show command. Application also
sends show AREXX command to another instance and quits.

When you are happy with prefs you can add it to user-startup using something
like: "run executer >NIL:"

---------------
SOURCE LICENSES
---------------

include/vapor.h - took from MophOS mplayer sources. But same header is used in
MorphOS Ambient desktop. I think Ambient is opensource so this is also. File
does not say it.

include/mui/BetterString_mcc.h - BetterString header. LGPL2.1 or later.

Rest: GPL2 or later.

----
TODO
----

Test filesystems: FFS and PFS.
Test network filesystems: Samba, NFS, FTPMount and NetFS(-revised).
